SELECT Product_Id, Region, SUM (Sales_amount) AS sales_performance
FROM Sales_sample
GROUP BY Product_Id, Region;
---------- b) Write a query to perform roll up from product to region level to view total sales by region.
SELECT Region, SUM (Sales_amount) AS Total_sales
FROM Sales_sample
GROUP BY Region;

---------- c) Write a query to explore sales data from different perspectives, such as product, region and date.

SELECT Product_Id, Region, Date, SUM (Sales_amount) AS sales
FROM Sales_sample
GROUP BY Product_Id, Region, Date;

-------- d) Write a query to slice the data to view sales for a particular region or date range.

SELECT Date, SUM (Sales_amount) AS sales
FROM Sales_sample
WHERE Date = '2023-06-10'
GROUP BY Date;

Or 
SELECT Region, SUM (Sales_amount) AS sales
FROM Sales_sample
WHERE Region = 'Karnataka'
GROUP BY Region;






-------e) e) Write a query to view sales for a specific combination of product, region and date.

FROM Sales_sample
WHERE Product_Id = 3 AND Region = 'Delhi' AND Date = '2023-06-03';
